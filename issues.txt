Apply update-manager patch to Ubuntu's update-manager and upload patched package to Vinux/Lucid
PPA.  The patch is at 
http://launchpadlibrarian.net/44134902/u-m-orca.diff
It needs to be applied to the file that gets installed to /usr/share/pyshared/UpdateManager/UpdateManager.py.

Deal with Firefox/Orca problems.  Firefox rewrote the caret navigation and it has bugs that make
structural navigation with Orca difficult.  The bug report is at
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=546068

fix gnome-app-install check-box bug.  Basically, Orca can't read the check-box
state.  I suspect that the patch to update-manager shows how to fix gnome-app-install.

Hack ubiquity/remastersys to allow language selection during install.  Currently, Vinux only
allows English installation, which is a major bug.

speechd-up says "capital" before all capital letters, which is frustrating.  Short term, switch to
using espeakup, rather than speechd-up, by compiling a custom version of espeakup with pulseaudio
support enabled, and uploading a new source package to the Vinux/Lucid PPA.  Long-term, work with
the OpenTTS guys to upgrade speechd-up to be as good as espeakup.

Get festival working.  Some users want it, but it doesn't seem to work in Vinux right now.

One person reported that there was no sound for a new user.  Verify this, and if true, debug.

Install borks Windows boot, but Lucid install does not.  Figure out what's going on, and
fix.

Fix voxin problems on 64-bit Vinux.

Determine why Computer Janator crashes.

Fix menu organization.  Some applications install to funny menu locations, like System Tools.
Check Attila's menu hack in vinuxscripts/vinux_data/skel/.config/menus for how to do this.

Enable Control+Alt+Backspace logout keybinding in the set_vinus_globals script.

Change the text of the 'Install Vinux 3.0' icon to 'Install Vinux'

Pick a new background image as the original one seems to have been removed by the latest updates

New Features
------------
Add remastersys package to Vinux/Lucid PPA.  This is needed because sometimes the remastersys
repository is down. Also add the ceni .deb package as their server also seems irratic.

Add Wubi compatibility.  This is straight-forward, but a lot of work.  The best documentation is
in the source code, which you can check out with bazaar at:
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-installer/wubi/trunk/

Customize Ubiquity to allow CLI vs GDM selection during install.  This would allow us to install a
CLI or Gnome version of Vinux from the same CD.  Basically, hack ubiquity to have a new dialog
where we ask Vinux specific questions.

Write a tutorial for new users.

Write an OCR app.  There are lots of comments about this idea on the Vinux forum.

Write an audio book creator app.  I would prefer to enhance speech-dispatcher (now opentts) to
return audio data rather than playing it.  That way an audio book creation app could be written
easily in Python, and could use any voice Orca can use.

Voxin instegration.  We would like to allow users to buy Vinux with Voxin pre-installed directly
from the oralux.org web site.  It sounds like Gilles Casse is interested in helping make this
happen.

Integrate emacspeak.  First, just get it running in Vinux.  We may need to make a patched package
for it.  After that, it would be great to have a speech-dispatcher (opentts) driver for it.

Opensapi integration.  Basically, write a speech-dispatcher driver for opensapi.  This would
enable users to access a large number of Micrsoft voices.

Rewrite gksu as python dialog, rather than using zenity, so we can support all of the options of
gksu properly.  Also, make the dialog look nicer for sighted users.

Auto-recompile speakup when kernel upgraded.  Right now, every time Ubuntu upgrades the kernel,
users have to execute the restorespeech script to get speakup working again.

Build an automated test system that runs whenever we push changes to sourceforge, and probably
once each night as well.  It should e-mail a status report to team memebers.  I think a clean way
to do this would be with a virtual machine.  We could save it's state just before running the
buildvinux script, and we could enable ssh login so that we could send it commands remotely.  We
could have it reboot after running buildvinux, and verify that Orca is running at the GDM prompt,
and that speakup is also running.
