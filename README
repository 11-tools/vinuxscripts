These scripts build a Vinux-like environment on top of Ubuntu.  So far, it only
works with Ubuntu Lucid.  You need to install before running the scripts, with:

sudo make install

There are four scripts installed, they should all be run with sudo:

buildvinux - Updates sources.list, updates to latest, and runs restorespeech
             and set_vinux_globals.

restorespeech - Modifies system to allow speakup to run, and restores login
                window speech. .

set_vinux_globals - Set's default Vinux keybindings, menus, and other user
	            settings for all users.  Optionally set Vinux-style desktop.
              
buildvinuxiso - After running buildvinux, run buildvinuxiso to create a Vinux
                ISO.  This removes many files from your system!  

In addition, we replace gksu with simple scripts that wrap around sudo,
since gksu causes problems with accessibility.  The issues.txt file is just an
informal list of tasks that need to be worked on.

Finally, the tinytrace directory is a simple trace program for python
applications.  It is included here since it was very helpful in
debugging ubiquity in Live CD mode.
