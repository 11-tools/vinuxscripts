These scripts build a Vinux-like environment on top of Ubuntu.  So far, it only
works with Ubuntu Lucid.  You need to install before runnng the scripts, with:

sudo make install

There are four scripts installed:

buildvinux    - Updates sources.list, updates to latest, and runs restorespeech
                and set_vinux_gloals.

restorespeech - Modifies system to allow speakup to run, and restores login
                window speech. Run this with sudo.

set_vinux_globals - Set's default Vinux keybindings, menus, and other user
	       settings for all users.  Optionally set Vinux-style desktop.
               Run with sudo.

buildvinuxiso - After running buildvinux, run buildvinuxiso to create a Vinux
              ISO.  This removes many files from your system!  Run with sudo.

In addition, we replace gksu with simple scripts that wrap around sudo,
since gksu causes problems with accessibility.  The issues.txt file is just an
informal list of tasks that need to be worked on.

Finally, the tinytrace directory is a simple trace program for python
appllications.  It is included here since it was very helpful in
debugging ubiquity in Live CD mode.
