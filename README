These scripts build a Vinux-like environment on top of Ubuntu.  So far, it only
works with Ubuntu Lucid.  You need to install before runnng the scripts, with:

sudo make install

There are four scripts installed:

buildvinux    - Updates sources.list, updates to latest, and runs restorespeech and
                set_vinux_gloals.

restorespeech - Modifies system to allow speakup to run, and restores login window speech
                Run this with sudo.

set_vinux_globals - Set's default Vinux keybindings, menus, and other user
                settings for all users.  Run with sudo.

buildvinuxiso - After running buildvinux, run buildvinuxiso to create a Vinux ISO.  This
                removes many files from your system!  Run with sudo.
