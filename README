These scripts build a Vinux-like environment on top of Ubuntu.  This branch works with Ubuntu Precise.  You need to install before running the scripts, with:

sudo make install

set_vinux_globals - Set's default Vinux keybindings, menus, and other user
	            settings for all users.  Optionally set Vinux-style desktop.

volume_keys - sets the gnome volume keybindings (don't run with sudo)
              
buildvinuxiso - After running buildvinux, run buildvinuxiso to create a Vinux
                ISO.  This removes many files from your system!
