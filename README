These scripts build a Vinux-like environment on top of Ubuntu.  So far, it only
works with Ubuntu Lucid.  You need to install before runnng the scripts, with:

sudo make install

There are three scripts installed:

buildvinux    - Updates sources.list, updates to latest, and runs the other two scripts
restorespeech - Modifies system to allow speakup to run, and restores login window speech
restore_vinux_environment - Set's Vinux keybindings, menus, and other user settings.  This
                must be run as the user who's environment is to be changed.
