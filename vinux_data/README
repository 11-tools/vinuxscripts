The EasyInstall directory gets copied to /usr/share, so that users can execute these scripts
from a menu or desktop icon.  The Meuse files get copied to /usr/share/applications.  This adds
new menu items for all users.  The skel directory gets copied to /etc/skel, which is the set
of files installed in a user's home directory by default.

In general, try to keep the skel directory as small as possible, to minimize the chance that
we have stale configurations for applications, or that we overwrite some config data without
meainging to.

The contents of the skel directory are:

Desktop - Installs EasyInstall icons on the user's desktop
.gconf - Contains Gnome settings for the bottom panel and the background image.
         To rebuild the panel, make your edits to your desktop, and then copy
         ~/.gconf/apps/panel into vinux_data/skel.  To change the desktop background, edit
         vinux_data/skel/.gconf/desktop/gnome/background/%gconf.xml directly
.local - Contains EasyInstall menus
.orca  - Contains default Orca configuration
