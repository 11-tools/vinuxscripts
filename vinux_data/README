The EasyInstall directory gets copied to /usr/local/share, so that users may execute these scripts
from a menu or desktop icon.  The Menu files get copied to: 
/usr/local/share/applications.  This adds
new menu items for all users.  The skel directory gets copied to /etc/skel, which is the set
of files installed in a user's home directory by default.

In general, try to keep the skel directory as small as possible, to minimize the chance that
we have stale configurations for applications, or that we overwrite some config data without
meanging to.

The contents of the skel directory are:

.gconf - Contains Gnome settings for the bottom panel and the background image.
         To rebuild the panel, make your edits to your desktop, and then copy
         ~/.gconf/apps/panel into vinux_data/skel.  To change the desktop background, edit
         vinux_data/skel/.gconf/desktop/gnome/background/%gconf.xml directly

.local/share/orca  - Contains default Orca configuration

The EasyInstall_skel directory only gets copied to /etc/skel if the user does a buildvinuxiso
and selects to remove applications to make the ISO fit on a CD.  Subdirectories are:

Desktop - Installs EasyInstall icons on the user's desktop

.local - Contains EasyInstall menus

keybindings - This is a text file describing all Vinux specific keybindings

ubiquity.patch - This is a patch file needed to fix ubiquity so that it works well with
Orca without crashing.

Backgrounds - Background images for Vinux
