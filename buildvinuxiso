read input

fi

exit=0

Other scripts to include:

ubuntu-restricted extras (EasyInstall-Restricted)

I may add more later...

29. Place all EasyInstall scripts into a folder called EasyInstall in the home
directory and create desktop launchers for each. Make them an application in
terminal and make sure the name matches the name given in the script. e.g.
EasyInstall-Office in this case (the .desktop is added automatically).

EasyInstall Scripts (EasyInstall Menu)

Accessibility Menu

31. Next run remastersys and change the username to 'vinux' and the name of the
CD and ISO file to 'Vinux-3.0-Alpha-3(.iso)'

32. Copy all the files in your home directory starting with to /etc/skel.

33. Run remastersys in 'dist' mode from the Menu Launcher or the terminal. The
iso should be in /home/remastersys in about 15-20 minutes.

34. Due to changes made to the installer which remastersys does not yet support,
you have to add a file to the iso, using isomaster. Create a file called
'filesystem.size' in the /casper directory, which should contain the number
3000000000.  Save the new iso and regenerate the md5 sum file.

OR

35. Run "remastersys dist cdfs" first (instead of 'dist'), then do the
following:

Open the /home/remastersys/remastersys/ISOTMP/casper directory as root and
create the filesystem.size file containing 3000000000 (3 and 9x0's).
